DESCRIPTION
    For my final project, I implemented a web portfolio that showcases my skills, experiences, and passions as a pre-health student. 
    The web portfolio was designed to be more personable compared to a more professional CV pdf. 
    I showcase some experiences that I would have on my CV. The interactability of the site allows me to describe each experience in more detail, including 
    more of my voice about what made each of the experiences meaningful to me. It is interesting and engaging because it is animated to bring out my personality/energy, and 
    also very simple in design that it is not difficult to interact with. The target audience would be med school admissions officers and medical professionals 
    who I might collaborate with in future experiences.

USING MY WEBSITE
1. HOME PAGE 
* Watch the engaging typewriter carousel implemented for an introduction! 
* Clicking the flower emoji at the top left corner at any time will take you back to this home page
* Click experiences to go to a page about my experiences
* Click about me on the nav bar to go to a page about me

2. EXPERIENCES PAGE 
* This page features a Card Deck (Bootstrap) that includes a hover animation which communicates the affordance that it is clickable
* Clicking on any card will take you to a new page with more details about that specific experience

3. DETAILS PAGE 
* Read more about the specific experience! 
* Interacting with the blue next/previous experience buttons allows you to read about the next experience details page without having to return to the card deck view 

4. ABOUT ME 
* Read more about me on the left column
* The right column includes a clickable link where you can access a pdf version of my CV 

EXTERNAL LIBRARIES
    Bootstrap
        I chose to use bootstrap because it was easy to implement with its many components and many options for styling HTML elements.
        The grid system was very intuitive and easy to use. 
        jQuery is built in, along with jQuery plugins that I was helpful in including more complex and engaging animations, such as the typewriter carousel. 

ITERATION FROM HW7
    I iterated my HW7 mockups on Figma by starting with the card deck as my main page. In experimenting with the prototyping, I knew that I had wanted to include 
    details pages for each experience card on the main page. After peer review and seeing other successful prototypes, though, I realized the importance of having a 
    main home page that showcases little information with a greeting. Using bootstrap styles allowed me to implement my design in a more complex and engaging way than I had expected.

MAJOR CHALLENGES 
    A challenge I had in implementing my design was getting familiarized with Bootstrap, as I am new to programming in HTML/CSS/JS. 
    The most difficult concept for me to understand was how to include the correct plug in source codes and set up the head environment.
